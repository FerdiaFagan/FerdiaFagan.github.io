    <p>Hello, my name is Ferdia Fagan.</p>
    <p>I am a final year CS software engineering student, at UCD college Dublin.
        This is my final year project.
    </p>

    <h3>In a nutshell: What is this application</h3>
    <br>
        This application is composed of two parts:
        <ol>
            <li>The browser plugin</li>
            <li>The native application (Java application)</li>
        </ol>

        As you search webpages through your browser, often we come across information we want to be able to find later.
        The "Google effect" is a term coined to refer to how humans are evolving to remember less of the actual
        information they read, and instead are remembering more where the information was found (and can be retrieved). 
        This I think personally is great news. I believe that as AI gets better, humans will become more and more in danger 
        of becoming obsolete by the tools we create... And so, a time will come that humans and machine will combine 
        (in certain ways that are to abstract currently to explain in a nut shell.).</br>
        <a href="https://academicearth.org/electives/internet-changing-your-brain/">Here</a> is an interesting paper and video about this "Google effect".</br>
        </br>
        I personally am most interested in the combining of humans and machines in respect to how we retrieve 
        information and remember things.</br>
        </br>
        So what this application does is:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Index as your browse the internet (i.e. your history) -> Similar to how Google scrape web pages for information, so you can search things. 
                Just to put your mind at ease: this application will not steal any of your data. Everything (including the index) 
                remains on your machine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keeps track of your search history, so can search through webpages you looked at in the past.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow users to tag and bookmarks webpages (i.e. annotate webpages with metadata) to then be searched through -> You will see what I mean by this if you watch the demo video. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow users to create what I called "auto annotators", which given hostnames will automatically tag webpages as you visit them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow users to then search through this index, filtering by dates, tags, bookmarks, 
                and most importantly a query made of keywords. Then the user can view the results.
            </li>

        </ol>

        So yeah, thats the nutshell. I think you will get a better picture if you look at the demo video.

        I also just want to re-iterate -> I am not taking ANY of your data. The philosophy behind this project 
        has a backbone of a belief that users (and society) should gain independance from big tech, 
        and should not have to contribute YOUR data unless you want to. And you definatly should not be bribed
        into using a service that exploits your personal data just because the service is free. </br>
        But, don't get your hopes up. This is a project I built in 3 months as a demo. 
        The search results will not be accurate. No competitor to Google... yet.

    <h3>Things to keep in mind when using the application</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You must spell query terms correctly. If you don't, it will not find that word in the index.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to use long queries of many words. 
            Let me know in the survey how it goes, and if it is very slow, etc.</li>
        <li>
            Try out and change the settings and see if you prefer the customization of when to index (described at the end of the video). 
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Requirements:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Firefox browser (please make sure to use an up-to-date version)</li>
            <li>Java: Use Java 11</li>
            <li>OS: Windows (Windows 8 or 10) or Ubuntu (linux)</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Ubuntu installation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Unzip the application.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then (with sudo) run the installation script located at: </br>
            KeepLivingInThePast_Application/linux_installer/install_on_linux.sh
        </li>
        <li>
            Then open Firefox browser and take the .xpi file located at: </br>
            KeepLivingInThePast_Application/browser plugin/keep_living_in_the_past_man-2.0-fx.xpi </br>
            and drag that file onto your Firefox browser window. Agree to the install 
            and the plugin will install into your browser
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the application!
        </li>
        <li>
            Then give feedback after maybe a week of use. No need to dedicate time explicitly testing this. 
            All I would ask is to install the browser plugin, 
            and when you are doing work/research and browsing using Firefox, use the plugin and see if it 
            helps you find the information you were looking for. 
            Then after some use, fill out the survey linked on this webpage.   
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Windows installation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Unzip the application.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then run this script as ADMINISTRATOR, located at: </br>
            KeepLivingInThePast_Application/windows_installer/install_on_windows.bat
        </li>
        <li>
            Then open Firefox browser and take the .xpi file located at: </br>
            KeepLivingInThePast_Application/browser plugin/keep_living_in_the_past_man-2.0-fx.xpi </br>
            and drag that file onto your Firefox browser window. Agree to the install 
            and the plugin will install into your browser
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the application!
        </li>
        <li>
            Then give feedback after maybe a week of use. No need to dedicate time explicitly testing this. 
            All I would ask is to install the browser plugin, 
            and when you are doing work/research and browsing using Firefox, use the plugin and see if it 
            helps you find the information you were looking for.
